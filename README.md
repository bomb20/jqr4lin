# jqr4lin
Java QR-code scanner for Linux


This project was created as an alternative to QtQR. By trying to fix all the issues 
in QtQR on my Arch-machine I decided that building an own application might be fun.
It also uses the zbar-libraries.

Please note, that jqr4lin is just started and still in prototyping stage.
